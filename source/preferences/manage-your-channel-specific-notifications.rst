  Alternatively, select the channel's **View Info** |channel-info| icon, and then select **Notification Preferences** in the right pane.

  **Mute channel**

  All channels are unmuted by default. Using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, mute a channel any time by selecting **Mute Channel**. Mute a direct message or group message by selecting **Mute Conversation**. You can unmute channels the same way by selecting **Unmute Channel** and **Unmute Conversation**.

  Using the mobile app:

  1. Tap the channel or conversation you want to mute.
  2. Tap the **More** |more-icon| icon located in the top right corner of the app.
  3. Tap **Mute**.
  4. Unmute the channel or conversation by tapping **Mute** again.

  Once a channel is muted:

  - Email, desktop, incoming call ring tones, and push notifications are disabled.
  - A mute icon displays next to the channel, direct message, or group message’s name.
  - The channel is dimmed in the channel sidebar, and isn’t bolded to indicate unread messages unless you’re :doc:`@mentioned </collaborate/mention-people>` directly.

  **Ignore channel-wide @mentions**

  By default, you’ll be notified every time someone on your team mentions an entire channel using @channel, @all, or @here.

  When using Mattermost in a web browser or the desktop app, stop being notified for channel-wide @mentions, by selecting the **Ignore mentions for @channel, @here and @all** option. Mention notifications for channel-wide mentions are ignored, but the channel is marked as unread unless it's muted.

  - In the desktop app, your mobile push notification preferences use the same configuration as the desktop app by default. Clear the **Use the same notification setting as desktop** option to customize your push notification preferences. You can receive notifications for all new messages; mentions, direct messages, and keywords; or no notifications within the desktop app.

  - In the mobile app, you're notified about all new messages by default. You can customize your mobile app notification preferences. You can receive notifications for all new messages, mentions only, or no notifications.

  - Select **Reset to default** to return to global defaults.

  **Desktop notifications**

    By default, your web and desktop notification preferences apply to all channels you’re a member of. You can customize notifications on a channel by channel basis if preferred by selecting **Desktop notifications**. Select **(Default**) options to revert back to your global preferences.

  **Mobile push notifications**

    By default, your mobile push notification preferences apply to all channels you’re a member of. You can customize notifications on a channel by channel basis if preferred by selecting **Mobile push notifications**. Select **(Default**) options to revert back to your global preferences.

  **Auto-follow all new threads in this channel**

  By default, you don’t automatically follow new conversation threads unless you start a thread or reply to a thread, follow a thread, or are @mentioned in a thread.

  You can configure Mattermost to automatically follow every thread in a channel. When enabled, you can access all threads in the **Threads** view, and unfollow individual threads as you prefer.
