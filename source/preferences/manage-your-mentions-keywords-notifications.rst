.. tab:: @mentions & keywords

  By default, you’re notified when you’re @mentioned in a message or a thread by your username or first name, or when a thread you’re following has a new response. For all other messages, the channel is highlighted to indicate unread messages.

  You're also notified when someone uses channel-wide :doc:`mentions </collaborate/mention-people>` including @channel, @all, and @here. 

  **Customize notification keywords**

  Using a web browser or the desktop app, customize any additional non case-sensitive keywords to trigger notifications. For example, you can receive notifications for all messages and threads related to a specific topic, project name, or customer. Separate multiple keywords using commas or by pressing :kbd:`Tab`, and use :kbd:`Backspace` to manage keywords.

**Passively track keywords (no notification)**

  From Mattermost v9.3, Mattermost Enterprise and Professional users interested calling attention to specific topics of interest across channels, at a glance, can do so without triggering notifications.
        
  Using a web browser or the desktop app, passively track key terms by specifying single or multi-words to highlight in all channels you're a member of. Keywords and phrases are automatically highlighted based on your :doc:`Mattermost theme </preferences/customize-your-theme>`.
