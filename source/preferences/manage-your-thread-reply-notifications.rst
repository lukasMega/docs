.. tab:: Replies

  If :doc:`Threaded discussions </collaborate/organize-conversations>` are disabled, you won't be notified in reply threads unless you're @mentioned. However, you can configure Mattermost to notify you when someone replies to a thread you started, or started or have participated in. Select **Reply notifications** to choose the option that works best for you. This setting is hidden when Threaded discussions is enabled.

  **Automatic replies**

  Mattermost also supports the ability to automatically send custom replies to direct messages. If your Mattermost admin enables this experimental feature, you can go to **Automatic Direct Message Replies** to select **Enable** this feature and compose your message.
