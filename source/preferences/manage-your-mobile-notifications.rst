 By default, you're notified of all Mattermost activity in Mattermost with badges, banner alerts, and sounds, regardless of how you access Mattermost, and your current :ref:`Mattermost availability <preferences/set-your-status-availability:set your availability>`.

  When accessing Mattermost using a supported web browser, the browser tab's favicon notifies you of unread messages with an asterisk (*) and a message count. From Mattermost v9.9, you're prompted to give Mattermost permission to send you notifications in the announcement bar.

    - When you select **Enable notifications**, you won't be asked again, and you'll start receiving Mattermost notifications in the web browser. 
    - If you dismiss the prompt, you won't receive notifications in the web browser, and you'll prompted again the next time you open Mattermost in a browser.

  **Want different notifications on mobile?**

  To personalize your notification preferences for the mobile app, select **Desktop and mobile notifications**, and then select **Use different settings for my mobile devices** to define how mobile notifications are triggered, when they're triggered based on you being online, away, or offline, and whether they include replies to threads you're following.

  **Getting too many notifications?**

  If you're receiving too many notifications, you can configure Mattermost to notify you for select messages only. Select **Desktop and mobile notifications > Mentions, direct messages, and group messages** to receive notifications for mentions, direct messages, and group messages only. This option also enables you to receive notifications about replies to threads you're following by selecting **Notify me about replies to threads I'm following**.

  Disable web, desktop, and mobile notifications altogether by selecting **Desktop and mobile notifications > Nothing**.



  From Mattermost mobile app v2.19, incoming call sounds on mobile include sounds and vibration, and vibration only when your device is in silent mode. You can set one **Incoming call sound** for web or desktop, and a different one for mobile. When you select an **Incoming call sound** on mobile, your changes apply only to mobile.
